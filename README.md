Build and deploy a program written in Rust that can retrieve price feed data from the [Solana Devnet Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/solana-price-feeds/).
This program depends on parts of the [smartcontractkit/chainlink-solana](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-solana) repository. See the [`Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-solana-demo/blob/main/Cargo.toml) file for the full list of dependencies.

Solana programs are stateless. If you know the program ID and the account for a deployed Solana program, you can skip to Part 2 and reuse that deployed program. At this time, this demo does not explain how to edit the code here without deploying your program.

1. Install the following dependencies:

    - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
    - [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools#use-solanas-install-tool)
    - [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

1. Check the installed dependencies to make sure that they function correctly:

    ```
    solana --version
    solana-cli 1.7.10 (src:03b93051; feat:660526986)
    ```

    ```
    cargo --version
    cargo 1.54.0 (5ae8d74b3 2021-06-22)
    ```

    ```
    git --version
    git version 2.32.0
    ```

1. Clone the [chainlink-solana-demo](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-solana-demo) repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-solana-demo
    ```

    ```
    cd chainlink-solana-demo
    ```

1. Set the Solana cluster (network) to [Devnet](https://docs.solana.com/clusters#devnet):

    ```
    solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
    ```

1. Create a [keypair](https://docs.solana.com/terminology#keypair) for your account that you can use for testing and development. For production deployments, follow the security best practices for [Command Line Wallets](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/cli#file-system-wallet-security).

    ```
    mkdir solana-wallet
    ```

    ```
    solana-keygen new --outfile ./solana-wallet/keypair.json
    ```

1. Fund your account. On Devnet, you can use `solana airdrop` to add tokens to your account:

    ```
    solana airdrop 5 $(solana-keygen pubkey solana-wallet/keypair.json)
    ```

    If the command line faucet doesn't work, use `solana-keygen pubkey` to see your public key value and request tokens from [SolFaucet](https://solfaucet.com/):

    ```
    solana-keygen pubkey ./solana-wallet/keypair.json
    ```

1. Build the program using the [Solana BPF](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust#project-dependencies):

    ```
    cargo build-bpf
    ```

1. Deploy the program. The output from the previous step will give you the command to execute to deploy the program. It should look similar to this:

    ```
    solana program deploy target/deploy/chainlink_solana_demo.so --keypair solana-wallet/keypair.json
    ```

    If the deployment is successful, it prints your program ID:
    ```
    RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
    Default Signer Path: solana-wallet/keypair.json
    Commitment: confirmed
    Program Id: AZRurZi6N2VTPpFJZ8DB45rCBn2MsBBYaHJfuAS7Tm4v
    ```

1. Copy the program ID and look it up in the [Solana Devnet Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet).

# Part 2: Read data from your program

For this part, build and run a script that completes the following tasks:

- Connect to the Devnet cluster (network)
- Deploy another program
- Connect an account to the new program
- Read the Chainlink price feed from our account

This example reads from the [SOL / USD price feed](https://explorer.solana.com/address/FmAmfoyPXiA8Vhhe6MZTr3U6rZfEZ1ctEHay1ysqCqcf?cluster=devnet) on the Solana Devnet. You can find more feed addresses on the [Solana Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/solana-price-feeds/) page in the Chainlink documentation.

1. Install the additional requirements. The client in this Demo uses Node.js and Yarn to interact with your deployed Solana program:

    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)

1. Change your directory to `client`, and run `yarn` to install Node.js dependencies:

    ```
    cd client
    ```

    ```
    yarn
    ```

1. Run `yarn start` to execute the script. The script completes the following steps. This does require SOL tokens, so you might need to add more funds to your Devnet account again:

    ```
    yarn start
    ```

    If the script executes correctly, you will see output similar to the following example:

    ```
    yarn run v1.22.10
    $ ts-node src/main.ts
    Let's work with Chainlink and Solana...
    Connection to cluster established: https://api.devnet.solana.com { 'feature-set': 660526986, 'solana-core': '1.7.10' }

    ```

If transactions are not confirming quickly, run `yarn start` again.
